### Hey, I'm Taniya Halder 👋  

I'm a first-year BS in Data Science student at IIT Madras, currently juggling  
**AI/ML 🤖, mern‑stack web dev 💻, and cybersecurity 🔐** because focusing on one thing is clearly not my personality type.

🎯 Goals: 
- 🌱 Learning: Python 🐍, ML basics 📊, HTML/CSS/JS 🎨, and slowly making peace with math 📐  
- 🧠 Interests: Cybersecurity, AI security 🛡️(red‑teaming 🎯), MERN stack ⚛️, open‑source 🌍, and building stuff that actually ships 🚀
- Short term: strong dev foundations 💪 + real projects (not just tutorial hell 😅)   

I like breaking things 🔨 to understand them, then rebuilding them cleaner 🏗️.  
If you see messy repos here, that's just **work-in-progress brain dumps** 🧠, not abandoned dreams (hopefully) 🤞
