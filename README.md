### Hey, I'm Taniya Halder 👋  
<img align="right" alt="Working on My Portfolio" width="180"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/229223156-0cbdaba9-3128-4d8e-8719-b6b4cf741b67.gif"/>


I'm a first-year BS in Data Science student at IIT Madras, currently juggling  
**AI/ML 🤖, mern‑stack web dev 💻, and cybersecurity 🔐** because focusing on one thing is clearly not my personality type.

I like breaking things to understand them, then rebuilding them cleaner 🏗️.  
If you see messy repos here, that's just **work-in-progress brain dumps** 🧠, not abandoned dreams (hopefully) 🤞
